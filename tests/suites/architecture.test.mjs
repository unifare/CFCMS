/**
 * Rule 4: data-access functions take `siteId` and `locale` explicitly, with no
 * default value.
 *
 * A `siteId = "default"` default is how a multi-site bug hides: the call site
 * compiles, runs, and silently reads the wrong site's data. Making the
 * parameter required turns that into a compile error. This was the root cause
 * of the `activeTheme()` defect fixed in v0.7.0.
 *
 * ✅ SATISFIED as of the batch-1 cleanup: all 26 defaults are gone. The ratchet
 * that previously allowed them has been deleted — this is now a hard rule with
 * zero tolerance, so there is no constant left to quietly raise later.
 *
 * The pattern also matches *constant* defaults (`siteId = DEFAULT_SITE_ID`).
 * An earlier version only matched string literals, which let six constant-form
 * defaults sit in src/api.ts while the test reported the rule as merely
 * "tracked". A default is a default regardless of how it is spelled.
 *
 * Precision matters here: a naive `siteId\s*=` match also fires on SQL
 * fragments (`WHERE locale=?`), object-literal properties (`{ locale: x }`)
 * and ternaries (`locale = a ? b : c`). So the pattern is anchored to a
 * *function parameter list*: match `=` only when the token is followed by a
 * literal default and the enclosing bracket is a `(`. The lookahead for
 * `=>`/`?` excludes arrow bodies and ternaries.
 *
 * Carve-out: a default is legitimate when the value is *derived from the
 * request* — `requestSiteId(url)` falling back to the default site is the one
 * place the choice actually has to be made. That is written as a call, not a
 * literal default, so it does not match (and does not need an exception list).

 * first written it caught the `=` spelling and the constant spelling; by
 * v0.7.1 two `??`/`||` fallbacks had quietly reappeared

 *  - `requestSiteId(url)` returns `DEFAULT_SITE_ID` — but as a `return`, not as

section("Bundled themes ship through Worker assets (rule 66)");
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Rule 65 exists because bundled themes used to have **no distribution
 * channel**: `seedBundledExtensions` wrote a registry row, but the actual
 * template/lang files only ever lived in R2 — and R2 starts empty. Every
 * database wipe therefore produced a homepage stuck in the `__fallback__`
 * shell at HTTP 200 until someone hand-uploaded the theme files object by
 * object; the "fix" was a manual `deploy-theme.mjs` run after every reset,
 * which is a patch, not a design.
 *
 * The design: bundled themes are read at runtime through the Worker's ASSETS
 * binding (`src/shared/bundled.ts`), served from `public/themes/**` — the
 * same directory wrangler uploads on every deploy. `content/themes/**` is the
 * editable source, `public/themes/**` is the synced copy (produced by
 * `scripts/sync-bundled-themes.mjs`, wired into `predeploy` and both
 * launchers), and this suite pins `public/themes/**` to **exactly the files of
 * the bundled themes**, byte-for-byte — so a template edited in `content/` but
 * never synced fails here instead of quietly serving stale markup in
 * production, and a directory that is not bundled (the test fixture) cannot
 * ride along into the deployed assets.
 *
 * Paired with the runtime fallback come the ownership guards: the bundled
 * names cannot be displaced by an upload or removed by an uninstall, because
 * "uninstall the default theme" would re-create the very fallback this rule
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Reverse validation: `tests/tools/_skeleton-inject.mjs` removes the assets
 * fallback, desynchronises a synced template, leaks a non-bundled theme into
 * `public/themes/`, and re-broadens the sync's copy set; the named assertions
 * below must go red on each defect.
