/**
 * Reverse-validation for tests/launcher-parity.test.mjs.
 *
 * A parity check that cannot go red is decoration. This tool injects one
 * violation at a time, runs the suite, asserts a *named* assertion fails, then
 * restores the file and asserts the hash came back.
 *
 * Three rules learned the hard way (AGENTS.md, "反向验证工具自身的三个铁律"):
 *   1. compare content hashes, never byte counts — `/shop/` -> `/blog/` is the
 *      same length and an equal-length replacement is invisible to a length guard
 *   2. assert the injection actually changed the bytes; "2 -> 2" is not evidence
 *   3. never use `git checkout` to restore — it cannot restore an untracked file
 *      and it fails silently. Snapshot the bytes here, and verify the restore.
