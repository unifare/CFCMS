/**
 * Reverse-validation for tests/suites/theme-fixture.test.mjs.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tests/tools/_fixture-inject.mjs inject <scenario>   # mutate themes/fixture
 *   node tests/tools/_fixture-inject.mjs restore             # byte-exact rollback
 *   node tests/tools/_fixture-inject.mjs list
 *
 * Not wired into `npm test` — it is a *tool*, run by hand when the fixture suite
 * itself changes, the same way you would re-inject a defect to check a guard.
 * See `tests/fixtures/_extension-rules.mjs` for the other half of that idea.
 *
 * This is the successor to `_eshop-inject.mjs`, carried across when the four
 * showcase themes were retired. The scenarios are not decoration: each one is
 * the *only* proof that a named assertion in the suite can go red. Dropping the
 * theme without porting the tool would have silently deleted that proof.
 *
 * ## Four mistakes this file exists to not repeat
 *
 * 1. **A byte-count guard cannot see a same-length mutation.** The first
 *    version asserted `before !== after` in *length*; `"/items/"` -> `"/blog/"`
 *    is not the same length, but the general case is: an equal-length edit is
 *    reported as "changed nothing" for a mutation that landed — a false
 *    negative in the very tool meant to prevent false negatives. Compare a
 *    **content hash**.
 *
 * 2. **`git checkout -- <path>` cannot restore a file git has never seen.**
 *    A brand-new theme directory is untracked, so `git checkout` is a silent
 *    no-op: every scenario stacks on the previous one and the suite accumulates
 *    failures from defects that were supposedly undone. Snapshot and copy back.
 *
 * 3. **A snapshot taken while the tree was already dirty preserves the dirt.**
 *    `assertPristine` rejects both a dirty snapshot and a restore that did not
 *    clean up, in both directions.
 *
 * 4. **A token count over raw source is fooled by a comment.** `assertPristine`
 *    counts `{{/section}}` to check that every child closes its sections. A
 *    `{{/section}}` written inside a `{{! ... }}` comment is not a closer —
 *    the engine strips comments before parsing — so counting raw text lets a
 *    comment *mask* an unclosed section. This is the eleventh false green
 *    recorded in AGENTS.md; the count here strips comments first.
