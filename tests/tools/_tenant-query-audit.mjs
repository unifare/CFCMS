/**
 * Source-level tenant-scope audit.
 *
 * The schema guard proves every table *has* a tenant answer. This one asks the
 * complementary question: does every *query* against a tenant-scoped table
 * actually use that answer? A table can be correctly shaped and still be read
 * install-wide — that is the shape of a multi-site leak, and it is invisible in
 * a single-site install.
 *
 * This is a **report**, not a pass/fail gate. A statement that omits `site_id`
 * is sometimes correct: a migration-wide backfill, a `SELECT COUNT(*)` used as
 * a health probe, or a query whose site filter is added by the caller through
 * `requestSiteId`. So it prints every hit with its file:line for a human to
 * judge, and exits 0 unless `--strict` is passed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tests/tools/_tenant-query-audit.mjs            # report
 *   node tests/tools/_tenant-query-audit.mjs --strict   # fail on any hit
