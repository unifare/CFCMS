/**
 * Drive every scenario in `_fixture-inject.mjs` and report, per scenario, which
 * named assertion went red — then restore and confirm the suite is green again.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a script and not a `for` loop in a shell
 *
 * This sandbox cannot spawn a child process: `spawnSync` fails with `EBUSY`
 * because the managed node binary is locked (the same reason `npm test` reports
 * SKIP here). A driver that shells out to `node tests/theme-fixture.test.mjs`
 * therefore cannot run at all — and "cannot run" would look like "no failures"
 * if the driver's own error handling were sloppy.
 *
 * So both halves are imported into *one* process. The suite reads the theme
 * from disk on every run, and the injector mutates the theme on disk, so the
 * loop is faithful: it is the same bytes a `node` invocation would see.
 *
 * ## What it proves
 *
 * Three things per scenario, all of which have failed before in this repo:
 *
 *   1. the injection **landed** (the injector throws otherwise, on a hash);
 *   2. the suite **went red**, and this prints *which* assertion — because
 *      "red somewhere" and "red at the right assertion" need opposite fixes;
 *   3. the restore **worked** (the suite is green again on the next iteration).
 *
 * A scenario that never reddens is reported as DEAD. A run with **no summary**
 * is reported as a failure too: a summary-less run is a crashed run, and this
 * repo has twice mistaken "grep matched nothing" for "no failures".
 *
 * Usage: node tests/_fixture-inject-verify.mjs
 * Not part of `npm test` — it is a tool, like the injector it drives.
