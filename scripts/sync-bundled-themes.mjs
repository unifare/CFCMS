/**
 * sync-bundled-themes.mjs — copy the **bundled** themes into `public/themes/`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (the "no patching" decision, 2026-10):
 *
 * Bundled themes (see `src/shared/bundled.ts`, `BUNDLED_THEMES`) are shipped
 * with the product and read at runtime through the Worker's ASSETS binding —
 * the same pipeline that serves `public/admin/`. `wrangler deploy` uploads
 * everything under `public/` automatically, so a database wipe followed by a
 * plain `wrangler deploy` (or migrations + deploy) renders the homepage with
 * no manual "upload 13 R2 objects one by one" step. R2 is left for themes the
 * user uploads and builds themselves.
 *
 * The assets root is `public/`, but theme sources live in `content/themes/`
 * (content = things that get LOADED; src = code). For every **bundled** theme
 * those two trees must agree byte for byte, and the agreement is produced here,
 * mechanically, before every deploy (`predeploy` in package.json) and before
 * dev serves them. The architecture test pins the mapping, so drift — a
 * template edited in `content/` but never synced, or a stale file left in
 * `public/` — fails the suite instead of quietly serving old markup.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Only `BUNDLED_THEMES` is copied, and that is a security boundary, not a
 * convenience.** This script used to mirror the whole of `content/themes/`,
 * which put the *test fixture theme* into `public/themes/` and therefore onto
 * the public internet: `https://<worker>/themes/fixture/theme.json` answered
 * 200 while `architecture.test.mjs` carried a comment calling the fixture "not
 * shipped as a product theme". The suite could not see it, because it asserted
 * the two trees matched — it had pinned the leak as correctness. Deriving the
 * copy set from the one definition of "bundled" is what closes it: a directory
 * under `content/themes/` that is not in that list is read by the suites and
 * never uploaded. The architecture test now asserts both halves (the tree holds
 * *exactly* the bundled files, and this script reads `BUNDLED_THEMES`).
 *
 * `public/themes` is therefore COMMITTED: CI and other machines get a correct
 * checkout without running this script first, and any hand edit is visible as
 * a normal diff.
