/**
 * Seed realistic demo content through the *API* rather than by writing SQLite
 * directly.
 *
 * Why it matters: `savePost` calls `bumpContentCache`, which is what retires
 * the cached HTML for a site. Writing to the database behind the API's back
 * leaves the old render in place and you end up staring at stale pages
 * wondering why your content edit had no effect.
 *
 * Every piece is written **twice, against the same post id**: once as the
 * default language and once as `zh-CN`. That is the shared-row storage shape —
 * one `posts` row carrying several `post_translations` rows — which is what
 * makes the two versions alternates of each other. It is what the language
 * switcher and the `hreflang` block read, so seeding a second language any
 * other way produces a site whose languages do not know about one another.
 *
 * ⚠️ Each language gets **its own slug** (migration 0016). The switcher on an
 * article therefore cannot swap the locale segment — it reads each version's
 * own URL out of `post.alternates`. Seeding the same slug for both languages
 * would hide that behaviour rather than exercise it.
 *
 * `category` and `tags` carry their own prose, so **each language writes its
 * own values** — migration 0019 gave `post_meta` a locale column, and a
 * category name is a word a reader sees. "Design" on a Chinese page is exactly
 * the half-translated page this seeder exists to make impossible.
 *
 * Local dev only. Usage: node scripts/seed-demo-content.mjs
 * Against a deployment: CFP_BASE=https://your.workers.dev node scripts/seed-demo-content.mjs
