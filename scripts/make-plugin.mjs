/**
 * `npm run make:plugin -- my-seo` — generate a plugin skeleton.
 * ARCHITECTURE.md §5.5.
 *
 * ## What a plugin *is*, in one paragraph
 *
 * A plugin ships **no executable JavaScript**. It is a manifest plus (optionally)
 * assets, and it is stored as a zip that the platform never unpacks. The
 * Workers runtime forbids `eval` / `new Function` / dynamic `import()` of user
 * code, so "run the plugin's code" is not a thing this platform can do — and it
 * would not want to. Instead the manifest *names hooks*, and the host supplies
 * each hook's implementation (see `contract/hooks.ts` and `plugin/runtime.ts`).
 *
 * That single constraint explains the two shapes an author finds surprising:
 *
 *   `hooks` is a list of **names**, validated against `DECLARABLE_HOOKS`. A name
 *   the host does not implement is now an install error rather than a silent
 *   no-op.
 *
 *   `langs` is **inline**, because there is no unpacked directory to read a
 *   `langs/{locale}.json` from. Themes ship files; plugins declare.

A CFPress plugin. Declarative only — no executable JavaScript ships in a plugin
package, because the Workers runtime forbids evaluating user code. Behaviour is
requested by **naming hooks** in \`plugin.json\`; the host supplies the
implementation.

## Declared surface

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| \`permissions\` | \`content.read\`, \`settings.read\`, \`settings.write\` | Approved at install time. Remove what you do not use — an over-broad plugin can be denied. |
| \`hooks\` | \`beforeRender\`, \`html\` | Must be names from \`DECLARABLE_HOOKS\`; anything else fails the install. |
| \`adminMenus\` | \`${name}-settings\` | Opens the settings screen generated from \`settings[]\`. |
| \`settings\` | \`enabled\`, \`note\` | Rendered as a form; keys must be declared before they can be written. |
| \`langs\` | \`en\`, \`zh-CN\` | Inline, because a plugin zip is never unpacked. |

## Install

\`\`\`bash
# Package and upload through the admin, or:
curl -X POST "$BASE/api/v1/extensions/plugins/upload" -b cookies.txt -F "file=@${name}.zip"
curl -X POST "$BASE/api/v1/extensions/plugins/${name}/enable" -b cookies.txt
\`\`\`

Enabling registers the declared menu for **every site** at once: a plugin has a
single install-wide enabled flag, not a per-site one. See ARCHITECTURE.md §4.4.
