/**
 * The authoritative answer to "what scope does this data live at?" (§10 rules 41–44)
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * A multi-tenant, multi-language CMS has exactly two axes on which *every*
 * stored row must have a defensible answer:
 *
 *   - **tenant** — which site does this row belong to? (`site_id`)
 *   - **language** — is this row per-language, or language-neutral? (`locale`)
 *
 * Neither axis is self-evident from a table's name. `media_files` looks global
 * and is not. `locales` looks per-site and is not — it is the platform's
 * language registry, shared by every site. Getting one of these wrong is
 * *invisible in a single-tenant, single-language install*, which is the only
 * configuration anyone tests by hand. That is precisely the failure mode this
 * file is built to make impossible.
 *
 * So the classification is *declared here, once*, and then **checked against
 * the real database** by `tests/architecture.test.mjs` (via a live
 * `PRAGMA table_info` walk). A table that is tenant-scoped must really have
 * `site_id`; a table that is not must be on the exempt list *with a reason*.
 * Adding a table without classifying it fails the suite.
 *
 * ## The three kinds of scope
 *
 * 1. **Tenant-scoped** (`TENANT_TABLES`) — one row per site. Must have `site_id`.
 * 2. **Platform-global** (`PLATFORM_TABLES`) — one row for the whole install.
 *    Must *not* have `site_id` (having one would suggest per-site copies that
 *    do not exist). Some of these are "child" rows reached through a
 *    tenant-scoped parent — `post_meta` joins to `posts.site_id` — and are
 *    listed in `DERIVED_TENANT_TABLES` to say so explicitly.
 * 3. **Generated** (`GENERATED_*`) — tables the platform creates from an
 *    extension declaration. Their shape is not fixed, so they are matched by
 *    pattern rather than by name, and the *rules* for their columns are stated
 *    instead of a list.
 *
 * ## Language is a different question from tenant
 *
 * Tenant scope answers "whose row is this". Language scope answers "is this
 * value the same in every language". They are independent: `settings` is
 * tenant-scoped and language-neutral; `locales` is platform-global and is
 * *about* language without being per-language; `theme_eshop_product_i18n` is
 * neither tenant-scoped (it is reached through its parent row) nor
 * language-neutral.
 *
 * `LOCALE_TABLES` therefore lists, by table, *how* language is expressed —
 * because "has a `locale` column" is not the only shape. A versioned table
 * keys on `(post_id, locale)`; a sidecar keys on `(row_id, locale)`; the main
 * row of a sidecar pair carries `lang_group` and no locale at all.
 *
 * Keeping the *reason* next to each entry is the point. A bare allow-list rots;
 * a list where every entry has to justify itself gets re-read.
 */

/**
 * Every table in the platform schema, with its tenant + language scope.
 *
 * `tenant`: `"site"` (must have `site_id`) or `"platform"` (must not, and the
 *           note says why).
 * `derivedTenant`: for platform tables reached through a tenant-scoped parent,
 *                  the FK column that carries the scope. These are genuinely
 *                  tenant-isolated, just not by a local column.
 * `locale`: how language is expressed, or `null` for language-neutral.
 *           - `{ kind: "column" }`  — a `locale` column on this table
 *           - `{ kind: "sidecar" }` — paired `X` + `X_i18n` (this is the `X`)
 *           - `{ kind: "i18n" }`    — this IS an `X_i18n` sidecar
 *           Note: sidecar tables have no `site_id`; their scope is inherited
 *           from the parent row they point at via `row_id`.
