/**
 * The notification-channel contract (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.3, batch 10).
 *
 * ## What a channel is, and who does what
 *
 * A channel is one way of delivering a notification — a webhook POST, an email.
 * The split of responsibility is the same dependency inversion the rest of this
 * directory uses:
 *
 *   the *specification* lives here (host)
 *   the *declaration* lives in `plugin.json` (plugin: "I provide `webhook`")
 *   the *implementation* lives in the host (`extensions/plugin/channels/`)
 *   the *configuration* lives in the database (per plugin, per site)
 *
 * A plugin never sends anything. It says which channels it offers and what
 * settings each one needs; the host reads that, renders a settings form from it,
 * and performs the send. In a no-build Workers runtime this is not a limitation
 * being worked around — it is the only honest shape: a plugin cannot execute
 * code in the host process, so anything it "does" has to be something the host
 * does on its behalf.
 *
 * ## Why `dedupKey` is in the contract rather than left to plugins
 *
 * The most common real bug in notification code is sending the same event twice
 * — a retry, two concurrent requests, a hook that fires more than once. Every
 * plugin would invent its own half-solution; putting the key in the contract
 * means the host does the deduplication once, for everyone.
 *
 * ## The closed type sets
 *
 * `ChannelConfigField.type` and the block types in `manifest.ts` are closed
 * sets for the same reason `ALLOWED_TABLE_FIELD_TYPES` is: the admin form is
 * *generated* from the declaration, so a type with no control renders an empty
 * input and looks like broken data. Add a type here and you must add its
 * control — `tests/architecture.test.mjs` matches the two lists up.
 */

/**
 * One configuration input a channel needs.
 *
 * `key` is what the host stores; `labelKey` is a dictionary key, never literal
 * prose (§10 rule 11 — `plugin.{name}.…`), so the settings form translates.

 * absent — v0.8 implements notification only, and listing an unimplemented
