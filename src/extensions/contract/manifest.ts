 * allowed capability names, the allowed admin screens, the six field types a
 * generated table may use, the reserved columns, and the shape rules for the
 * identifiers that end up inside generated SQL or R2 keys.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate file from `validation.ts`
 *
 * `validation.ts` asks "is this particular manifest acceptable?" and produces a
 * message. This file says what exists at all. Keeping them apart matters because
 * the vocabularies have **other readers**: `tests/architecture.test.mjs` reads
 * this file to check that every *shipped* theme and plugin only uses screens
 * that exist, and the admin SPA needs the same set to decide whether it has a
 * renderer. When the list lived inside the validator, the only way to check a
 * shipped manifest was to copy the list — and a copy drifts.
 *
 * So: **add a screen or a field type here, and every reader sees it at once.**
 * Nothing may re-declare these lists locally.

 * How a declared table stores its language dimension (§10 rule 42).

 * both, and inferring the second from the first is how the `_i18n` naming rule
 * ended up hand-rolled in two places.
 *
 * The three strategies:
 *
 * - `"none"`     — the table holds no prose; every column is language-neutral.
 *                  A table of prices and flags. `translatable` must be empty.
 * - `"sidecar"`  — the default, and the only one v0.8 materialises. Prose moves
 *                  to a generated `{table}_i18n` keyed `(row_id, locale)` once
 *                  the site serves ≥2 languages; the main row keeps copies so a
 *                  second language needs no migration. Mirrors the platform's
 *                  own L1 design (§2.3).
 * - `"versioned"`— one full row per language, discriminated by `locale`, with
 *                  `lang_group` tying the versions together. The shape
 *                  `posts` + `post_translations` already uses. Declared here
 *                  for tables an extension manages in that style; v0.8 does not
 *                  generate these, so declaring one is an install error until
