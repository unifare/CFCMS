/**
 * Capabilities an extension may ask for, and the check for one.
 *
 * A capability is the unit of "what an extension is allowed to do": the
 * manifest lists them, an admin approves them at install time, and every
 * platform call the extension makes is gated on one (`host.table()` needs
 * `content.write`, `admin.register` gates menus, …).
 *
 * Kept separate from `manifest.ts` because the list has a second reader that
 * has nothing to do with manifests: the permission layer, which answers
 * "does this user hold this capability on this site". A vocabulary that both
 * the declaration surface and the runtime gate depend on belongs to neither.
