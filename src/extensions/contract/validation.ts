/**
 * The install boundary: is this manifest acceptable? (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.3)
 *
 * A manifest is the **only** place an extension can get it wrong in a way that
 * surfaces far from the mistake. A typo in `translatable` does not fail the
 * install; it produces an `_i18n` table with no column for the field the theme
 * then writes to, and the error appears at render time pointing at the renderer.
 * A `table-list` menu naming an undeclared table installs cleanly and opens an
 * empty page.
 *
 * So everything that can be checked is checked here, and **a failure throws**:
 * `validateManifest` raises, `src/api.ts` catches and returns 400. A theme that
 * cannot be installed beats a theme that half works — the second one costs a
 * debugging session, the first one costs a re-upload.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * The vocabularies (allowed screens, field types, reserved columns) live in
 * `manifest.ts` so other readers can share them; the capability list lives in
 * `capabilities.ts` for the same reason. This file only decides.
 *
 * ## The second line of defence
 *
 * Two of these rules are also enforced against the *shipped* extensions by
 * `tests/suites/architecture.test.mjs` (screen names, and route/tables agreement).
 * That is not duplication: the test guards what is in this repository, this
 * guards anything installed at runtime from a third-party zip.

 *       `.js`/`.ts` file in the package. A Workers runtime cannot load plugin
 *       code, and running it would breach the capability model, so a manifest
 *       that asks for it is rejected with the reason rather than ignored.
 *   49. every `adminPages[].blocks[].type` is one the SPA renders.
 *   50. a `plugin-page:<id>` menu opens a page the plugin actually declared.
 *   51. every channel `code` is one the host implements, and every
