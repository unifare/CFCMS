/**
 * Notification channel implementations (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.3, batch 10).
 *
 * ## Why the implementation lives in the host
 *
 * A plugin *declares* a channel (`channels[]` in `plugin.json`); the host
 * *performs* the delivery. This is not the plugin being short-changed — it is
 * the only honest shape in this runtime. A Cloudflare Worker cannot `eval`,
 * cannot `new Function`, and cannot dynamically `import` user code, so a plugin
 * that "sends" something would have to be one whose send function the host
 * loaded and ran. That is precisely the thing the capability model exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * So a plugin's value is what it declares, what it configures, and where its
 * data lives. The delivery itself is a host behaviour, keyed by the channel
 * `code` the plugin named.
 *
 * ## The shape every implementation has
 *
 *   `send(env, siteId, pluginName, config, message)` → `ChannelSendResult`
 *
 * It never throws. A delivery that fails is a value, because the caller is a
 * hook firing on a request path: an exception here would turn "the webhook was
 * down" into "the page 500s", which is exactly the failure mode `runtime.ts`
 * guards every hook call site against.
