/**
 * Layer ② of the UI dictionary: packs declared by enabled plugins.
 *
 * ## Why inline rather than `langs/{locale}.json`
 *
 * A theme package is exploded into R2 file by file, so a theme's pack is a
 * plain object read. A plugin package is **not** — `uploadExtension` stores it
 * as a zip and stops there. Reading a file out of that zip on every admin
 * request would mean unzipping in the hot path for a handful of strings.
 *
 * Plugins are declarative manifests anyway: they name hooks and the host
 * supplies the implementation. Declaring their strings the same way keeps the
 * whole extension in one auditable file:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "name": "seo",
 *   "langs": {
 *     "en":    { "plugin.seo.meta.title": "Meta title" },
 *     "zh-CN": { "plugin.seo.meta.title": "页面标题" }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Keys still carry the `plugin.{name}.` prefix (§10 rule 7); the architecture
 * test scans the shipped `plugins/*\/langs/*.json` files, and
 * `validateManifest` rejects an inline pack whose keys are unnamespaced.
