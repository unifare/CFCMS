/**
 * The unified admin menu registry (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.4).
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `platform/` and not in `extensions/`
 *
 * Both extension kinds write here: a theme registers its menus when it is
 * activated, a plugin registers its when it is enabled. If this module lived
 * under `extensions/theme/`, the plugin path would have to import it — and
 * rule 3 of §7.3 forbids `extensions/theme/` and `extensions/plugin/` from
 * importing each other. If it lived under `extensions/plugin/`, the reverse.
 * Neither extension kind may own a table the other one also writes.
 *
 * `platform/` is the lowest layer that is allowed to know about the database
 * and is importable by every extension, so it is the only correct home. The
 * dependency direction stays one-way: `extensions/` → `platform/`, never back.
 *
 * ## Why ownership is a column and not a naming convention
 *
 * `owner_type` + `owner_name` are what make "disable the SEO plugin and only
 * the SEO plugin's menus disappear" a `WHERE` clause instead of a guessing
 * game. The alternative — encoding the owner into `menu_id`, or trusting that
 * `sort_order` ranges do not overlap — breaks the moment two extensions pick
 * the same id, and it breaks silently.

 * A `site_id` meaning "every site on this install".

 * Themes are activated per site, so their menus are per site — that is the
 * whole point of the theme/site split. Plugins are not: `plugin_installs.enabled`
 * is a single install-wide flag, and there is no per-site plugin switch to
 * mirror. So a plugin's menus have to answer "which site?" somehow, and the
 * two candidate answers are both bad:
 *
 *   fan out on enable   writes N rows and needs a second hook on site
 *                       creation. Miss that hook and a new site silently has
 *                       no plugin menus — a missing-UI bug with no error.
 *   one shared row      this. One write on enable, correct for sites that do
 *                       not exist yet, nothing to keep in sync.
 *
 * The magic value is confined to the read and write helpers in this file; no
 * caller has to know it exists except the plugin registration path, which
 * passes it explicitly.
