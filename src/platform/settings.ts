/**
 * Two-level settings: **platform** (install-wide) and **site** (per site).
 *
 * ## Why two levels
 *
 * `settings` is site-scoped (`UNIQUE(site_id, key)`) and `deleteSite()` purges
 * it per site — correct for `site.title`, wrong for the backend's own path: a
 * deleted site must not take the admin's configuration with it, and two sites
 * must not be able to disagree about where the admin lives. `platform_settings`
 * is the platform half; `settings` stays the site half.
 *
 * ## The ladder is defined here, and only here
 *
 * `getSetting()` is the single place that answers "what does this key resolve
 * to for this site", per the key's declared `scope`:
 *
 *   - `platform`  → `platform_settings` → the declared default
 *   - `site`      → `settings(site_id)` → the declared default
 *   - `site` with `inherit` → site value → platform value → declared default
 *
 * There is **no implicit cross-level fallback**: a `site` key never borrows the
 * platform value unless it declares `inherit`. That keeps "which level decided
 * this" a property of the declaration instead of a property of the call site.
 *
 * ## Writing
 *
 * `setSetting()` / `setPlatformSetting()` write per the declaration and
 * **reject an undeclared key** rather than ignoring it. A settings key nothing
 * declares is a key nothing can reason about: nobody knows its scope, its
 * default, or whether it is read at all. `tests/tools/_setting-keys.mjs` makes
 * the same demand of every literal in the source.

/**
 * Every settings key the platform reads or writes, with its scope.
 *
 * `scope: "platform"` — install-wide; one row for the whole install.
 * `scope: "site"`     — per site; `deleteSite()` purges it (see `onSiteDelete`
 *                       in `contract/schema.ts`).
 * `inherit: true`     — a `site` key whose *default* is the platform value,
 *                       so the platform can set a value every site inherits and
 *                       a site can override it. Only meaningful for site keys.
 * `sensitive: true`   — the admin must not echo this value back into a form
 *                       field after it has been set (it is a secret-shaped
 *                       value); a placeholder is shown instead.
 *
 * ⚠️ The declaration is total on purpose. A key that is read or written and is
 * missing here fails `tests/tools/_setting-keys.mjs`, which is what stops
 * "where does this setting live" from being decided ad hoc at the call site.
