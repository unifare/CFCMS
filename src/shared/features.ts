/**
 * Platform feature switches — the switch vocabulary and its resolver.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `shared/` and not in `extensions/contract/`
 *
 * It started in `contract/manifest.ts` as a vocabulary entry, which is where
 * every other declaration lives. That was wrong for one specific reason:
 * `shared/cache.ts` is a consumer, and `shared/` is a **leaf** (§7.3 rule 5) —
 * it may not import `extensions/`. `architecture.test.mjs` caught it:
 *
 *     src/shared/features.ts -> ../extensions/contract/manifest  (reaches extensions/)
 *
 * The three fixes available were: (a) move the consumer out of `shared/`,
 * (b) weaken the layering rule, or (c) move the vocabulary down. (a) is not
 * possible — the content-cache version genuinely belongs to `shared/cache.ts`
 * — and (b) would be the first crack in a rule that exists to stop exactly
 * this. So the vocabulary moved to the leaf. It is imported from
 * `./shared/features` by its two consumers (`api.ts`, which owns the admin
 * endpoints, and `extensions/theme/runtime-worker.ts`, which reads the sandbox
 * switch); `api.ts` sits above `shared/` and `index.ts` is the only file that
 * knows every layer, so both imports are legal and no re-export is needed.
 *
 * ## Why one object, not three constants
 *
 * Each switch has **three readers that must agree**: this resolver, the admin
 * screen that edits it, and the `vars` name in `wrangler.jsonc`. Any one of
 * them spelling the key differently produces a switch that saves fine and does
 * nothing — the "declared but never consumed" defect this repo has fixed five
 * times. So key, var name and default are defined once, per switch, here.
 *
 * ## Precedence, highest first
 *
 *   1. `settings` row `cfpress.features` for this site (set from the admin)
 *   2. `env.<varName>` from `wrangler.jsonc` `vars` (set at deploy time)
 *   3. the switch's `defaultOn` (both switches default to off)
 *
 * ## Failure policy
 *
 * Every step is wrapped. A switch that cannot be resolved reads as **off**,
 * which is the safe direction for both consumers: the KV mirror is skipped and
 * worker themes fall back to the declarative renderer. Neither degrades the
 * site. The runtime path is deliberately forgiving because it is on the
 * critical path of every page render, while each consumer still requires an
 * explicit "on" before it does anything.
 *
 * A settings row that is present but does not mention this switch (because it
 * was saved before the switch existed) falls through to step 2, not to the
 * default — otherwise adding a key to the admin would silently disable an
 * already-enabled var.

/**
 * The slice of `Env` this module needs.
 *
 * Declared structurally rather than importing `Env` from `./types`, because
 * `types.ts` imports nothing and this module must not become the reason it
 * starts to: `Env` names `WorkerLoader` and `R2Bucket` from
 * `@cloudflare/workers-types`, and pulling those in here would couple the
 * switch resolver to the whole platform type surface for the sake of one
 * field. A structural parameter also lets the test suites pass a plain object,
 * which is exactly what they do.
 *
 * Note there is deliberately **no index signature**. Adding one
 * (`[k: string]: unknown`) looks convenient — the `vars` lookup is dynamic —
 * but it makes every real `Env` unassignable, because TypeScript then requires
 * `DB`, `CACHE`, … to each satisfy `unknown`, which structural typing does not
 * do. Reading a var goes through `readVar()` instead.
